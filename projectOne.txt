Q.1 Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under each FBICode.



A = load'/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' using PigStorage(',');

B = foreach A generate $0 as Id, $14 as FBIcode;

C = Group B by FBIcode;

D = foreach C generate group,COUNT(B.Id) as noofcases;

Dump D;



Q.2 Write a mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under FBICode 32.



A = load'/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' using PigStorage(',');

B = foreach A generate $0 as Id, $14 as FBIcode;

C = Group B by FBIcode;

D = foreach C generate group as code,COUNT(B.Id) as noofcases;

E = filter D by code =='32';

Dump E;



Q3. Write the mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of arrest in theft district wise.



A = load'/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' using PigStorage(',');

B = foreach A generate $5 as type,$8 as arrest,$11 as district;

C = filter B by type=='THEFT' AND arrest=='true';

D = foreach C generate type,district,arrest;

E = group D by district;

F = foreach E generate group ,COUNT(D.arrest);

Dump F;



Q4. Write mapreduce/pig program to calculate the number of arrest done between oct2014 and oct2015.



A = load'/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' using PigStorage(',') As(f1:chararray,f2:chararray,f3:chararray,f4:chararray,f5:chararray,f6:chararray,f7:chararray,f8:chararray,f9:chararray);

B = foreach A generate SUBSTRING(f3,0,10) as datestring,f9 as arrest;

C = foreach B generate ToDate(datestring,'MM/dd/yyyy') as date,arrest;

D = filter C by date>ToDate('10/01/2014','MM/dd/yyyy') and date<ToDate('10/31/2015','MM/dd/yyyy');

E = foreach D generate date,arrest;

F = filter E by arrest=='true';

G = foreach F generate date,arrest;

H = group G by date;

I = foreach H generate group,COUNT(G.arrest);

Dump I;
